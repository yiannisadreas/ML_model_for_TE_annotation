# Data accumulation

The data used here were of the species D. melanogaster. Of course, the scripts can be used on any data of any species if it has the same structure as the one used here. 

First is needed a file that contains known transposable elements (DNA transposons and LTR Retrotransposons) is needed to train the machine learning model. 
Then you only need some genome files(.fasta files), and the scripts can use the best model to analyze and give an output based on the density of transposable elements in the genome file.
